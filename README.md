# Triples with Properties

I have two integers S and T. He wants to count all possible triplets of non-negative integers(a,b,c) which satisfy the below conditions:
a+b+c<=S and a*b*c<=T
our task is finding the count of such triplets.

Write a program that reads the two space-separated numbers S and T, and prints the count of triplets of non negative integers(a,b,c) satisfy the above conditions.
